# Eight-Puzzle:
  This program will solve a square matrix of width n, which will contain nxn tiles. 
  You can place the tiles of number 0 to nxn in any place of the matrix. 
  In this program you are given three different sort algorithms which will solve the nxn matrix at different speeds.
  The three algorithms are Uniform Cost Search, A* Misplaced Tiles, and A* Manhattan. 

# Feature Selection:
  This program will find the best set of features using either the Forward or Backward Selection algorithm. 
  The best set of features will be the set of features which will allow the algorithm to gain the highest accuracy of predicting the type of a subject.
